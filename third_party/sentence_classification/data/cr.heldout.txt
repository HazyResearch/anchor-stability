1 i do give create to creative for their attractive design
0 it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do
1 it also lets you remove songs from the play order
1 i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !
1 i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini
1 the 6600 \( t mobile \) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia \( 900 \) whereas the 6620 \( available from singular \) replaces it w 800mhz \( some refer to as 850 \)
0 it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it
1 good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro
0 do n 't buy this player
1 i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever
0 the only thing i do n 't like about this is the cover does suck
0 tech support from apex is literally nonexistent
0 the volume level of the phone is not all that good
0 seemed like a good deal , but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes , no disc
1 the dvd player is fine
0 quite simply , the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time
0 this thing is trash
1 all the cool features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5
1 when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra it 's that good !
1 this is a wonderful camera
0 just the home version of norton internet av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with
1 the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot
0 i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable
1 i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium ion battery , an ac dc power adapter , a usb 2 0 cable , a belt clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick start guide , and creative mediasource software
0 you can 't change the battery , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so
1 this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features
0 verdict had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game
0 it does take some getting used to
1 the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch
1 great features
1 the setup was very easy
1 in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room
1 the included leather pouch is a big plus it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices
1 8 connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth
1 the blue backlight is pretty cool
0 we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only
0 we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working
1 feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there
1 apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players
1 this is a great product !
1 i use a nokia 6600 , it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom , which complement a built in video recorder with audio and a real one player for playback and streaming of 3gpp compatible and real media video clips
1 but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity an exceptional close up shooting capability
0 however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all dosn 't work at all in the car , for example
1 the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details
1 i will also say that setting up the e mail account was very simple and straight forward , although you do need an external smut server to use
1 i 'm amazed at the photo quality prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints
1 the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers
1 it looks sleek and modern
1 the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy \( and i think trendy good , but it 's always hard to tell these days \)
1 transferring music is a breeze i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes
1 my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems
0 i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table
1 the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice
1 saw the hitachi on amazon com with their 25 00 coupon \( at the time \) and could not resist trying it out
1 by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced
0 a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy
1 the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery \( but at least this one is removable \)
0 but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything
0 it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras
1 the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods
0 regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop
1 i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product
1 because this camera is beautiful
0 the only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment
1 my experience with installation was quite good
1 no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find !
1 but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad
1 it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point and shoot we 've ever tested
1 perfect size ! beats the competition by leaps and bounds
0 i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs the windows firewall , and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a customer priority id number
1 the bass is deep and the treble is clear
0 only then did i learn the truth this phone does not work with palm pdas !
0 the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to
1 it plays alternate video formats \( cads , svcds , cods \) very well
1 thank you apple ! you make fabulous products
1 the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep
0 well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise
0 
0 the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17
0 i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open close scanning that it does with every program
0 the only main drawback is the fact that the voice dialing system is kinda picky
0 my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of
1 5 the price is right
0 having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying
1 just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time
0 but not good enough for me
1 i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi \( my only hitachi tool , by the way \) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder
1 the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class
1 ability to play most discs i tried dvd , vcd , dvd r , audio cd and it played all
0 overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion
1 in conclusion , this player is beautiful
1 all in all suprisingly easy to use
1 i use the same store brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it no special diaper trash bags necessary
1 the fact that has an open source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion
1 overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it
1 ripping your songs and creating playlists could n 't be any easier
1 this is an excellent router for the price
1 great phone
1 freebies you get a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful
1 lastly , the price is fantastic
0 it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error
1 just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it
1 it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse
1 remember , this phone uses an operating system symbian and it 's feature rich w 65k colors
1 overall , i 've been very impressed with the player
1 other plusses changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod
1 it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid
0 sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault
1 i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision
0 respectable , solid , but not awe inspiring
1 i use it on a router table , and it is works well
1 i did like the heft of the machine
1 all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price
1 ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well
1 the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market
0 the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective
1 even did while daughter sleep and no noise !
0 2 it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow
1 \) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors
0 if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop off in sound quality may take some getting used to
1 longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities
0 the only problem is the size of the keys
1 i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it
0 the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost
0 my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn 't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag
1 first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software
1 hold button suprisingly not all mp3s have this this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket
1 in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4 5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly
1 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price
0 creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack
1 so far the dvd works so i hope it does n 't break down like the reviews i 've read
0 you must keep double checking depths
0 to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid
1 the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick
0 they play just about everything , but 2 and 3 died very shortly after getting them
0 diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first
0 the build quality shows why its so cheap small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel
1 in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution
0 basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help
1 with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches
0 the plug er gets stuck you have to manually extract the mess
1 i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www ipod 's dirty secret com
1 the radio and voice recording are nice
1 the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation a slightly audible click if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click
1 after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine
0 i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed
1 and i must say this mp3 is very cool
1 i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler
0 the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing !
0 it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10 20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod
1 the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful easy to use , high quality , and compact in size
1 the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4 times optical zooms gets you just that much closer
0 so i e mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive \( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs \)
1 am so glad i bought this camera
1 the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead
1 camera is a paper weight
1 the in program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well
0 symantec should give us all a refund and apology !
1 i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it
1 at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in then there is no smell at all !
0 unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing \( or installing \) them individually
1 this is an excellent router for the money
1 i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal
1 their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific
1 has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great
1 it has everything i needed bluetooth , infrared , support for mmc , camera , and a good operating system with lots of supporting software
1 gets nice sound too
1 which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net
1 many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me
1 great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
1 fits well in hand in trouser pockets
0 the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega pixel camera
0 you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry
0 i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004
1 owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide
0 my jpeg pictures are viewable \( not so sharp and vivid \) on my 27 screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 monitor
0 again , every review written about the tech line is true after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep
1 the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect
1 all in all , this is a wonderful device
1 after installation , which was very simple i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music
1 i prefer things that are simple
1 other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either
0 1 a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet
1 the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
1 the sound is quite good , in terms of volume
1 i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that
0 it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 of the quality that you would from a true line out jack
1 it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera \( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! \)
1 it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer !
1 and the video quality is amazing
1 battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware requires a windows pc or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet awesome sound quality i mean it is creative right \?
1 when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental
0 you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with
1 i also wanted to switch to broad com hardware \( which the linksys uses \) because my wifi menisci card in my dell laptop with lucien silicon in it used 70 of my 1 2ghz laptop 's cpu when using the wireless at full speed
0 no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones
1 if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player
0 it would just spin up and stop , and display no disc
0 apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster 's services
1 1 \) great sound \( 98db signal to noise ratio beats ipod 's unspecified ratio \) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head phones as well as external speakers
1 it plays everything , even vcd 's
0 they are a royal pain to install , and don 't function properly once finally installed if you can install them at all
0 you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll
1 i 've had nothing but good luck with t mobile
0 you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best
1 i love all of the features , and presets as well
0 after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash \( read most reviews on amazon com and see for yourself \)
0 the door would not close
1 i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick
1 it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside
1 the sound quality is fantastic \( cd quality \) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
1 believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
1 the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom
0 it ain 't cutting edge \( no pun intended \) state of the art with all the latest bells whistles it definitely ain 't pretty
1 friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on line reviews and i have been happy with it
1 all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed \( ipod , archos , dell , samsung \)
1 they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self timer
1 accessing files by artist and album \( i mostly look things up by artist \) is easy and intuitive
1 overall it is a great value
1 i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it it 's size
1 also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo 's
0 after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design \( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells \)
1 this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong
0 i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise
1 i compared it to other cd players \( two models of panasonic , rio samsung \) and they were no way even near zen micro
1 the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate
0 not a killer problem , but not well done , either
0 my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above
0 with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock \( and , of course , the speed and on off controls \)
0 too costly and not efficient if you ask me !
0 the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best
0 i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for
0 canon 's g3 does it consistently
1 well , i have an ipod mini and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more
1 all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment
1 it is the most bang for the buck out there
1 the phone is small , light , and very attractive
1 mine installed no problem \( but i did uninstall my norton anti virus 2002 personal firewall 2002 first \)
0 other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard 2 5 mm headset jack
0 the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others
1 
1 four megapixels is great
1 sound this is where i love zen the most
0 the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned
0 hard drive screws up occasionally
1 great camera
1 the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes
1 i treat the battery well and it has lasted
1 it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice
1 original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great !
1 it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go !
1 it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market
1 another plus in my book , no file limits !
1 i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too
1 these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable
1 the fm radio is cool
1 the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use
1 the zen offered a great alternative
1 there are extra features packed inside this unit \( some that most will hardly ever use \) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock
1 whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio
1 not only is it much more cost effective \( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at 5 a pop \) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity
1 a sony erickson may be the phone for you but good luck finding one w all the features such a competitive price
0 they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware
0 the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed
0 also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable
1 the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus
1 the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust
1 besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
1 pros excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set
1 there are a lot of things i like about it
1 so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all
1 a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer
0 second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating
1 so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation !
1 it is a nice router in all ways but one
1 this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website
0 can 't say whether i rec 'd an updated model but it will not read dvd rw 's or vcd 's for me
1 creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices
0 after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while
1 6 \) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic
1 4 looks great
1 excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players
0 however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience do not purchase this product
1 even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity
1 i didnt have any installation problems and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate
0 all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift
1 creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device
0 however , this product performed well below my expectation
1 each battery lasts about 10 11 hours
0 i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites
1 the battery is removable
0 the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on
1 the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50 mbs from my backyard
0 2 \) the body construction buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic
1 among my requirements for a phone were good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support
1 the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere
0 the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least
0 this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway
1 i like the automatic key lock function
1 bottom line great product , unbeatable price
1 i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far very easy to use both the ipod and itunes
0 during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so
1 the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen
1 i highly recommend this phone
1 pros huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
0 if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't
1 i have set up it 's pda features with avaunt com where you can download info from sites like weather , map quest maps directions into it , which is great
0 the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark
1 we tried it out christmas night and it worked great
1 after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed
1 fm transmitter \( belkin has a good one \) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find connected this baby to my 3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod
0 this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files just subscription wma files
0 even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start up
1 the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies
1 i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra , it was definitely worth it
1 after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking
0 i tried to contact apex to return it \( i missed the amazon return period \) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept
1 you can use it as a storage hard drive
1 the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog
1 the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use
0 i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen
1 it has a classic design yet looks hip
1 i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
0 this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free
1 overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too
0 the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too they look as though they were built out of lego 's
1 if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty , this is the player to get ! highly recommended
1 the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic \?
0 i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you
1 probably a great phone overall , and perhaps mine just has bugs
1 anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago
1 huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you
0 while the software may not be as easy as i tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch
1 other than that , i love this camera
0 the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with canned air
1 you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right
1 what impressed me most was the sound
0 at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my alias dvds as well
0 the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory
0 and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control
0 it worked from 12 26 to 1 9 at which time the picture failed completely \( see other negative reviews my unit was n 't the only one this happened to \)
