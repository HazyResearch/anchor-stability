1 and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan
1 it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great
1 
0 the software , which comes with player is not good at all
1 my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not whine during video , and my pictures are razor sharp
1 the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough
1 surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available
0 for example , i tried playing my new pirates of the caribbean extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it
1 \( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them \)
1 it comes with a good case that fits it snugly
1 not counting the time i spent editing the songs \( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc \) the transfer was pretty painless
1 this is a great diaper pail
0 i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed \( mainly the slow processor \) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely !
1 supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone
1 the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
1 3 \) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff
1 great camera , great investment !
1 i have n 't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box
0 i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media
1 the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy
0 a \) feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
1 anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it
1 its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen
1 this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly
1 i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it
0 i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly \( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode \)
0 sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task
1 it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight
0 i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head to head with the digital rebel
0 i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment
1 it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to
1 manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding
1 i think their antivirus software was one of , if not the best , on the
0 the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while , prompting a reset
1 i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like
1 after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures
1 the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's notmad software because of some advanced features i wanted
1 the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good but i was wrong !
0 this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online
0 and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title
1 i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under 1500 i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
0 the dvd player just would 't recognize them
0 i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out well , just be prepared
0 their customer \( www apex digital inc com \) service is very poor
1 the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect
0 i will never buy a creative product again
0 the scroll button is sort of annoying to push a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal
1 you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini
0 that 's when it went from oder less , to odorous !
0 first , the sound quality is okay , but \( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned \) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes
1 other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again
1 memory storage seemingly boundless
1 as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better
1 i am extremely satisfied with this camera
1 i just bought this player today and i already love it
1 i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems
0 main dial is not backlit
1 for a sleeker , smaller and more average mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water the interface is great and the design is wonderful
1 another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load wav sounds as ringers
0 all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since
1 zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player
0 who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a foreign computer just to move over some simple \( txt \) files \?
1 with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long
0 i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t zones never worked
1 20 gb or 40 gb \? the pros of the 40 gb comes with a dock station and double storage space \( 10 , 000 songs \)
0 if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else
0 there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't
0 the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet
1 it is small
1 the fit and finish of the product is first rate
0 the sliding latch is does not stay in place
0 other tagging problems result \( i think \) from the nomad 's operating system
1 its compact and has rounded edges
0 4 my idea was that it was an all in one , and that theory once again proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the other than phone functionalists , you 'll be disappointed if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine but don 't expect to get much done
1 with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files \( from programs such as microsoft outlook \) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive
1 plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad
1 learning how to use it will not take very long
1 it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price
1 i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons
1 this is the mp3 player with everything i need as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied
1 it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well
1 the pictures are razor sharp , even in macro
1 i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money
1 however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all
1 the greatest thing about the software \( in my humble \) is that it reads your cd info
0 it does n 't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n 't generally have firewire cards themselves
0 when the player was working it was great , but
1 right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use
1 the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them
1 i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough
1 it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow
1 i bought it for my trip to buns aries , and also used it at the iguassu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
1 the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster
0 it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman
1 it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive
1 very simple to use
1 the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line
0 then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely
1 the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom
1 great phone , i 'd buy another
1 great design very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied \( virtual ones are the only competition \) and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus
1 you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3 player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gaps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone \( ! ! \) and also you can carry it in your pocket \)
1 if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it \( there are some offered here , for about 15 dollars i think \)
0 i read many reviews on norton i s 2004 from a variety of sources \( cnet , amazon , message boards \) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update
0 it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers
1 the arm band is fantastic and it doesn 't budge even at the gym
0 when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck !
1 i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so
1 hate to wait between shots
1 i am very pleased with it so far
1 so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality \? size 2
0 the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over \( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used go back \)
0 what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical
1 it takes great pictures
1 and it holds so much music and audio files
0 luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger
1 the software you get with this camera is perfect
0 one still works fine , the other quit after one day
1 the g3 looks like a work of art !
1 i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great
1 yes , the features are numerous
1 the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc other niceties , that you would enjoy
0 yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway
1 in a week of use i 've never had to reboot the router
0 my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long
1 i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs
0 not plug play relies on id3 no fm or recording
1 it is crystal clear
1 this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great
0 i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all
1 creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean
0 i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail
1 it can not be the computer or the owner , since i purchased mcgee anti virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems
1 i use the scented bags and even if i don 't no smell !
1 this player seems to work fine with everything else
1 no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks \( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink \) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space
0 3 4 way through the first disk we played on it \( naturally on 31 days after purchase \) the dvd player froze
1 i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
0 my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made
1 the service from the supplier was exceptional
1 uploading music is quick and easy
1 the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered
0 i then realized a major design flaw
0 the cons are n 't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where separated into folders \( on the pc \) and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another
1 at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod
0 one downside as of this writing , t mobile has n 't updated their t zone system to fully support the 6610
0 imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega strongest fm signals in my area
0 the user support service isn 't too great either
0 it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation
1 this is a great camera for you !
0 games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games
0 also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n 't always accurate
0 the price is more
1 the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal
0 i tried called apex cu st service , no help
1 yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order \( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out \) it actually turns out to be really handy
1 bright , visible screen
1 finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig \( well 18 gig \) worth of music
1 i am very pleased with its quality and durability
1 great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous
0 a little weighty \( 9 ounces no biggie \) , but otherwise fine
0 it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk
1 feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore
1 there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful
0 after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player
0 i built my own router table with a tilt up top made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob these two things make it easy to change out raise or lower the bits
1 the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack
0 i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location
1 i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot
0 however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand \( i keep it mounted in a table \)
1 one it 's size it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music \( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs \)
0 it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music
0 the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line
1 this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8 track records
1 i 'm not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i 'm very fond of it
0 images taken indoor were n 't so clear
0 then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one
0 the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot
0 even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with mac settings , etc
1 works perfectly with my netgear wireless paramecia
1 this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well
1 and it is extremely well priced for what you 're getting
1 great screen and great sound
1 however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority
1 it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite
1 it 's easy to use not too small , and not too big
1 don 't care about sunlight it 's tft
1 extremely convenient
1 but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
1 honestly , i love this player
0 the buttons are rather stiff
1 the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive
1 amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping
1 as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen
1 it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to moderate snapping
1 i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size
1 my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
1 uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple
1 compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck
0 only one disk played through to completion successfully
0 if there was a zero star rating i would give it
1 the sound quality is excellent , accessing the music is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out
0 kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that
1 the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight
1 the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality
1 so reliability is the winner here for the ipod
1 the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing
1 it also holds a lot more diapers
1 ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion
1 outside of the t mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at t wireless and various other services where the t mobile service was unavailable
0 the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated
0 a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet
1 i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it
1 they are extremely convent and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i tunes , which provides quality music at low prices
1 and we still love it !
1 it 's cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges
0 other than that it is all the same except the new updates
1 this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has
0 this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 !
1 i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags
1 playlists can be generated on the fly \( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus \) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options
1 the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god
1 in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus
1 i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to maneuver through the menus quickly
1 all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time
0 if you have an older version of internet security installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install
1 i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon
1 the auto mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual
0 it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment
1 this router has soft start and runs smooth and true
0 in short nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm , and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly
0 when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture !
1 i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! ! !
1 this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation
0 his is what i get for my 200 on this mp3 player \?
1 the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter
1 the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad
1 just bought one i 've enjoyed it to date
1 even with the waterproof housing it is small
1 the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake
1 3 bags are easy to change
1 price and capacity
0 i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software
1 whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together
1 i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture
1 the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did
1 price , along with the replaceable battery \( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it \) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad
0 their site offers no live help at all
0 the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming
0 i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended
1 the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
1 these include mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less it is very user friendly simply by right clicking the file \( s \) to be converted
0 it had a heavier and more sturdy casing
0 i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem
0 the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap \( it is not very snug and can come off too easily \) and the lens itself \( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd \)
0 while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with alerts every twenty seconds \( literally \) , warning me my antivirus protection was off
1 i like the size and weight of this little critter
1 the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use
1 i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive
0 this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing
0 creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked
1 especially for the price amazon gives it at \( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications \)
0 the box included a little polyester , pull string bag , \( yes , you read right a bag , something a boy would carry ten marbles in \) and tries to pass it off as the case
0 this phone doesn 't include phone card calling
1 regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go
1 have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility
0 some dvd 's i rented would not play
1 file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 0
1 have a great and easy to use bundled software
1 i still give the ipod five stars , though , as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install \( though i did follow the onscreen prompts \) so i 'll give apple the benefit of the doubt
0 included creative software is pretty poor
1 basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n 't used
1 the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly
1 i have to say that i am very happy with it so far
1 the player is great
1 when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome
1 retraction said mine had silver plate it does have display
1 it was also the most appealing
1 i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx \( on the pc \)
0 short warranty \( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy \) , occasional freeze up \( easily fixed by popping out battery \) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel
1 the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling
1 it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well
1 i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth
1 this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual
0 i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n 't do it !
0 it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it
1 what i like the most small and solid feel
1 i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker
1 i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new 300 systematic because he saw what this router can do
1 i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it
1 the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced
0 2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations
0 the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad
1 newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box
1 way to go apple !
0 it wo n 't play all of my movies
0 my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful
1 a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it
1 this product is way cooler than anything ive used before \( pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone \)
1 3660 had similar features , but that is big in size
1 took hundreds of pictures and they were great
0 up , down , left , and right would have given me better control
1 the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11 18m speed that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard
0 lens cap is a really annoying
1 so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine
1 however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 of the shots that i take
1 the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out \( as all lithium batteries do \) , you will be able to buy another easily
1 also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds \( my old apex ad 1200 had trouble with these \)
1 personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ
1 i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price
0 i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler
1 you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus
1 i must have gotten a good one
0 radio quality weak reception
1 this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift
0 unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming
1 its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillow side
0 5 \) lack of good accessories this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing
0 anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants
1 i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk it 's all ways in my shiest pocket
1 i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time
1 4 \) usb 2 0 means fast data transfers \( 1 song sec ! \)
1 to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player
1 this thing does everything but washes your dishes
1 at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria
0 scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models
0 other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better
0 it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart
0 gets stinky after a few months , the seal on the piston doesn 't seal anymore
1 the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days
1 if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
0 software music match jukebox is n 't the greatest , the search function is n 't fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut
1 i never get dropped calls
1 i was looking for a compact , rugged \( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc \) camera which is easy to use
1 the size of the camera is perfect
1 its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset
1 it does well in all aspects of internet browsing
0 even after all the nightmare sound problems , i 'd still half way like this product if it kept it 's promise the ability to store 1500 songs
1 the battery is replaceable \( a real plus \) and there is a leather case \( another real plus \)
1 i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola 's do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine
1 the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files
1 this is the best dvd player i 've purchased
0 2 \) not very ergonomically you 'll find even for a point and shoot lens \)
1 we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully
1 it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing
0 i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful
1 the functionality on this camera is mind blowing
1 this is the first cell phone i 've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it
0 my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units
0 such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in wrong !
0 the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customizable as well
0 b \) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage
1 i am very pleased with the apex ad2600 it plays just about anything you put in the drawer
0 the software that came with it was tough to load
0 the player 's mechanics are also flawed
1 the battery holds a charge for a very long time \( maybe 15 or so hours of use \) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use
0 the auto focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject
1 usb 2 0 transfer is insanely fast
1 as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all
0 i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard
1 the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long
1 nice little phone light compact
0 the other thing i do n 't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated
1 has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range
1 the micro seemed like an ipod for less
1 it works well enough \( so far \) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something
1 nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby
0 holy cow ! it really does scratch easily !
0 i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues
1 the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving
0 my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again \( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating \)
1 these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one
0 no way to contact their customer service
1 i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself \( and i do ! \)
0 we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped
0 i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience
0 all the camera 's functionality is only available \( or selectable \) when the screen is functional
1 being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills
